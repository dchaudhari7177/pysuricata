"""Presentation changes on every commit. The facts change on exactly two.

That sentence is the organising claim of the whole redesign, and this file is
what makes it checkable.

Fourteen issues rewrote every template, stylesheet and card renderer. An HTML
snapshot test is worthless against that: the diff is 100% churn on every commit,
so nobody reads it, so a real regression rides in unnoticed. These three tests
check the thing that actually has to hold instead.

1. **The fingerprint.** The set of numbers the report asserts, with every trace
   of how they look discarded.
2. **The golden payload.** ``summarize()`` is a versioned contract; snapshot it
   and require equality. Milliseconds to run, and the only thing standing
   between *a CSS refactor* and *a CSS refactor that quietly changed the
   median*.
3. **Fact coverage.** The real risk of restacking a card is not a wrong number,
   it is a **missing** one — and no snapshot diff shows that in a document
   where every line changed.

Regenerate the fixtures deliberately, never to make a red test green:

    uv run python tests/test_report_data_invariance.py --write

Deliberate fact changes so far, each with the reason it was allowed:

* **#253, the histogram bin counts.** Re-binning rounded each bin to nearest
  and then dumped the entire residual into the one bin with the largest
  fractional part. On `Fare` at 50 bins that residual was -3 into a bin holding
  2, so the report shipped a bin of **-1**. Replaced with the largest-remainder
  method, which preserves the total the old code was reaching for *and* cannot
  go negative. 82 facts moved, all of them `count` and `pct` on the two numeric
  columns; **no fact was added or removed**, and no bin moved by more than one
  row. The old numbers were wrong, so this fixture records the corrected ones.

* **#291/#292, the datetime card face.** `Weekend %` and `Business hrs %` left
  the stat grid to become bars drawn against the flat-calendar share, and `Avg
  interval`/`Interval std` moved into the Statistics pane. **No number
  changed**, and no number left the report: 27.3% and 24.2% are still asserted
  by the Statistics pane (`weekend ratio`, `business hours`) and now also by
  the baseline panel (`weekend share`, `business hours`). What the fixture
  recorded and this run does not is the two *labels* the face no longer uses.

  The extractor was loosened first, not the fixture -- `report_fingerprint.py`
  knew table cells and `.vstat` rows but not the panel's `__label`/`__value`
  spans, so it collected nothing from the new shape and two displayed facts
  read as removed. That is the #114 over-fitting again. Loosening it also
  brought the summary composition counts into the fingerprint, which is four
  facts checked that never were.

* **#295, three categorical statistics on two-level columns.** `Entropy`,
  `Rare levels` and `Top 5 coverage` describe how a distribution spreads across
  its levels, and the card rendered all three for every categorical column
  regardless of whether it had a spread to describe. They are now suppressed
  where their own arithmetic cannot carry information -- see
  `categorical_card.suppressed_statistics` for which rule drops which. **8 facts
  removed, none added, none changed**, and every one of the eight is on `sex` or
  `cabin`, the frame's two two-level columns: `top 5 coverage 100%` on a column
  with two levels is the top *five*, so it was 100% by construction rather than
  by measurement; `rare levels 0` counted a tail that does not exist. Removing a
  fact is the change this file exists to make expensive, so note what did
  **not** move: `col_name` keeps its entropy, because the fixture gives its head
  distinct counts and a column whose levels genuinely differ still has a spread
  worth reporting.

* **#329, the duplicate-count interval.** `duplicate_rows_est == 0` cannot be
  told from "below the sketch's own resolution" without also reading
  `duplicate_rows_uncertainty` and reconstructing the bound in prose --
  `duplicate_rows_lo` / `duplicate_rows_hi` publish that arithmetic directly, the
  same interval the report already computed. **2 facts added, 0 changed, 0
  removed**, both `0` on every fixture here since none of the three frames has
  an unresolved or resolved duplicate count to bound.
